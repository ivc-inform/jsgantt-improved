      * pID:	(required) a unique numeric ID used to identify each row
      * pName:	(required) the task Label
      * pStart:	(required) the task start date, can enter empty date ('') for groups. You can also enter specific time (2016-02-20 12:00) for additional precision.
      * pEnd:	(required) the task end date, can enter empty date ('') for groups
      * pClass:	(required) the css class for this task
      * pLink:	(optional) any http link to be displayed in tool tip as the "More information" link.
      * pMile:	(optional) indicates whether this is a milestone task - Numeric; 1 = milestone, 0 = not milestone
      * pRes:	(optional) resource name
      * pComp:	(required) completion percent, numeric
      * pGroup:	(optional) indicates whether this is a group task (parent) - Numeric; 0 = normal task, 1 = standard group task, 2 = combined group task*
      *
      * * Combined group tasks show all sub-tasks on one row. The information displayed in the task list and row caption are taken from the parent task. Tool tips are generated individually
      * * for each sub-task from its own information. Milestones are not valid as sub-tasks of a combined group task and will not be displayed. No bounds checking of start and end dates of sub-tasks is performed
      * * therefore it is possible for these task bars to overlap. Dependencies can be set to and from sub-tasks only.
      *
      * pParent:	(required) identifies a parent pID, this causes this task to be a child of identified task. Numeric, top level tasks should have pParent set to 0
      * pOpen:	(required) indicates whether a standard group task is open when chart is first drawn. Value must be set for all items but is only used by standard group tasks. Numeric, 1 = open, 0 = closed
      * pDepend:	(optional) comma separated list of id's this task is dependent on. A line will be drawn from each listed task to this item
      * Each id can optionally be followed by a dependency type suffix. Valid values are:
      * 'FS' - Finish to Start (default if suffix is omitted)
      * 'SF' - Start to Finish
      * 'SS' - Start to Start
      * 'FF' - Finish to Finish
      * If present the suffix must be added directly to the id e.g. '123SS'
      * pCaption:	(optional) caption that will be added after task bar if CaptionType set to "Caption"
      * pNotes:	(optional) Detailed task information that will be displayed in tool tip for this task
      * pGantt:	(required) javascript JSGantt.GanttChart object from which to take settings. Defaults to "g" for backwards compatibility
      *
